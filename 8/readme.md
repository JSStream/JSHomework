# Homework

## None this time

You can always read the chapter in Eloquent JavaScript <https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html>
We'll spend more time with classes and OOP stuff in the other lecture.

As for those who didn't participate in last JS stream - I also recomend reading the chapter <https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html> (untill section "Overriding derived properties").
