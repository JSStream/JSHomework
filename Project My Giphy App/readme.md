# Project

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to test and strengthen what you have learned from all the lessons.

Expect that you will need to google stuff, read about modules, promises and async/await  contact me if you’re really stuck.

Don’t get stuck on styling too much. CSS whole another topic. Use flexbox for layout, the rest is up to you. A good flexbox tutorial <https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/>

Vital part of programming in any language is to read code. So read my implementation or some other solution, to get some inspiration.

## App requirements

Really simple:

1. App should be able to search and then load giphy data from Giphy API.
1. Extract gif and other data and populate view with gif images.
1. Let the user load more results if he wants (on the same search keyword).
1. Page should have some sort of navigation. If you click on a navigation item – it will search/load gifs by a predefined keyword.

## Start by

1. Use the basic-template in examples folders as a starting point for your Giphy app.
1. Put all JS code or modules to the app folder.
1. In the app folder try to structure code/files to models (data contracts), services (classes that do something for the app a.k.a business logic), http clients (classes that do the communication with the Giphy API).
1. Use modules. Read more about them at:
* Eloquent JavaScript <https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html>
* RequireJs (we’ll be using it in our project) <https://requirejs.org/docs/why.html>


Your app’s entry point is in app/main.js.


Or you can try doing any some other way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Good luck!
