# Homework for JavaScript course

Will be adding new homework for each new session.

## Content
Each session will have dedicated folder with homework in it. You will want to clone or simply download repository and then implement assigned homework tasks.

## Editors
You can use any editor you want (Notepad++, Sublime Text), but we recommend: **Visual Studio Code**.

## Browsers
Although IE and Edge should be sufficient for most of sessions, we still recommend getting one of the more popular browsers: **Chrome or Firefox** to be able to use the latest ECMAScript features.

## Rules
You want to create **your own GitHub repository** where you will be putting all of your completed homework assignments. This repository should have similar structure as this repository. Each session should have a dedicated folder with completed homework assignment.

At random, person or group of people will be chosen to present their homework at the beginning of each session, so be prepared.

## Uploading homework to GitHub
You can upload your finished homework via GitHub:
- Go to the your repository page
- Click on the "Upload files" button
- Drag and drop the folder with homework
- Click "Commit changes" button

**OR**

  install and use a Git client like GitExtensions or GitKraken.
