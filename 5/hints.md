### Beans counting hints

Your function will need a loop that looks at every character in the string. It can run an index from zero to one below its length (< string.length). If the character at the current position is the same as the one the function is looking for, it adds 1 to a counter variable. Once the loop has finished, the counter can be returned.

Take care to make all the bindings used in the function local to the function by properly declaring them with the let or const keyword.
