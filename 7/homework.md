# Homework

Let's play around a bit more with the SCRIPTS array!

## Try to get this info from the SCRIPTS array

1. All the scripts that start from letter 'A' and written from right to left ("rtl"). Return the result in an array of objects with a single property 'name'. Use array built-in methods.

2. Find the creation year of the most recent living script. Use the built-in array filter, map and reduce methods.

I added the solutions in the solution.js file. But try not to look at them :)

## And if you want more practice try these excercises

Excercises "Your own loop" and "Everything" from "Eloquent JavaScript" <https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html>

If you need solutions to these excercises you can find them at <https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/>

## If you have problems with any excercise try to read the chapter if the "Eloquent JavaScript". It realy is a great book at explaining things. Or try to reach me :)
